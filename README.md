TastingTonight 'landing page'
===========

Just wanted to throw this on Github for posterity's sake. Not like 'super proud'
of this or anything, but I am proud of how quickly I got it done. Judging by the
git logs this was about 5-6 hours of work, honestly can't remember if it was
continuous or interrupted or not. It didn't feel like 6 hours of work, more like 3 hours.

Mobile 'ordering' app done with JQuery Mobile.
